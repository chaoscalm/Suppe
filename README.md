Suppe is an Xposed module to disable SSL certificate verification on Android using the excellent technique provided by [Mattia Vinci](https://codeshare.frida.re/@sowdust/universal-android-ssl-pinning-bypass-2/). The effect is specified by the [scope](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/wiki/Module-Scope)

---

## Requirements
* An Xposed-compatible hooking system. 
    * [LSPosed](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPosed) 

## Tested
* Android 15 QPR2, ARM64, LSPosed v1.10.1

## Troubleshooting
* Some apps implement custom certificate checking, bypassing this hook. Try sniffing Chromium traffic, if you don't get an invalid certificate error then this module is working as it should.

* Check your LSPosed logs, chances are this module couldn't hook the correct method.
